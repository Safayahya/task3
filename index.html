        <h1>Welcome to Our Restaurant</h1>
       
            <h2>Restaurant Albaik's</h2>
            <p>Albaik's journey began in 1974 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, when Mr. Shukor Abu Ghazaleh, may God have mercy on him, sensed the community's need to innovate high-quality foods at prices suitable for all segments of society. He put his efforts and expertise into achieving Albaik's vision, which was embodied in its current form and the spread of its branches in most regions of the Kingdom. Albaik has become the first and most prominent player in the world of meals without dispute throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, mainly in the field of chicken, in addition to fish and shrimp meals and a long list of delicious and innovative products every time, with which we surprise our customers every period in a way that suits their taste and expectations and at competitive prices.</p>
